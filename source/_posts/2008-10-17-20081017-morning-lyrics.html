<blockquote>
	And if the darkness is to keep us apart<br />
	And if the daylight feels like it&#39;s a long way off<br />
	And if your glass heart should crack<br />
	And for a second you turn back<br />
	Oh no, be strong<br />
	<br />
	Oh, oh<br />
	Walk on, walk on<br />
	What you got, they can&#39;t steal it<br />
	No, they can&#39;t even feel it<br />
	Walk on, walk on<br />
	Stay safe tonight 
</blockquote>
