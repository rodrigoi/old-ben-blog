<blockquote>
	I tied myself with wire.<br />
	To let the horses run free.<br />
	Playing with the fire until the fire played with me.<br />
	<br />
	The stone was semi-precious.<br />
	We were barely conscious.<br />
	Two souls too smart to be<br />
	In the realm of certainty.<br />
	Even on our wedding day.
