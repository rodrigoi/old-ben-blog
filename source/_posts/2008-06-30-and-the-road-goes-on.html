<blockquote>
	Roads go ever ever on,<br />
	Over rock and under tree,<br />
	By caves where never sun has shone,<br />
	By streams that never find the sea;<br />
	Over snow by winter sown,<br />
	And through the merry flowers of June,<br />
	Over grass and over stone,<br />
	And under mountains of the moon.<br />
	<br />
	Roads go ever ever on<br />
	Under cloud and under star,<br />
	Yet feet that wandering have gone<br />
	Turn at last to home afar.<br />
	Eyes that fire and sword have seen<br />
	And horror in the halls of stone<br />
	Look at last on meadows green<br />
	And trees and hills they long have known.
