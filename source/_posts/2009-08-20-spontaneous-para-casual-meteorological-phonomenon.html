<blockquote>   <p>That night they stayed Outside the Asylum and watched TV from the inside it.</p>    <p>“This is what I wanted you to see”, said Wonko the Sane when the news came arround again, “an old colleague of mine. He’s over in your country running an investigation. Just watch.”</p>    <p>It was a press conference.</p>    <p>“I’m afraid I can’t comment on the name Rain God at this present time, and we are calling him an example of a Spontaneous Para-Casual Meteorological Phonomenon.”</p>    <p>“Can you tell us what that means?”</p>    <p>“I’m not altogether sure. Let’s be straight here. If we find something we can’t understand we like to call it something you can’t understand, or indeed pronounce. I mean if we just let you go arround calling him a Rain God, then that suggest you know something we don’t, and I’m afraid we couldn’t have that.</p>    <p>“No, first we have to call it something which says it’s ours, not yours, then we set about finding some way of proving it’s not what you say it is.</p>    <p>“And if it turns out that you’re right, you’ll still be wrong, because we simply call him a.. .er, ‘Supernormal’, not paranormal of supernatural because you think you know what those means now, no, a ‘Supernormal Incremental Precipitation Inducer’. We’ll probably want to shove a ‘Quasy’ in there somewhere to protect ourselves. Rain God! Huh, never heard such nonsense in my life. Admittedly, you wouldn’t catch me going on holiday with him. Thanks, that’ll be all for now, other that to say ‘Hi!’ to Wonko if he’s watching.”</p> </blockquote>  <p>Douglas Adams, So Long and Thanks for All the Fish, Chapter 33</p>
