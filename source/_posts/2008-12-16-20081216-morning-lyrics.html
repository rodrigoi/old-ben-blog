<blockquote>
	Nobody else here baby<br />
	No-one else here to blame<br />
	No-one to point the finger<br />
	It&#39;s just you and me and the rain.<br />
	<br />
	Nobody made you do it<br />
	No one put words in your mouth.<br />
	Nobody here taking orders<br />
	When love took a train heading south.<br />
	It&#39;s the blind leading the blond<br />
	It&#39;s the stuff, it&#39;s the stuff of country songs.
