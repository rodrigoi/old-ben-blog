<blockquote>
	Some days are dry, some days are leaky<br />
	Some days come clean, other days are sneaky.<br />
	Some days take less, but most days take more<br />
	Some slip through your fingers and on to the floor.<br />
	Some days you&#39;re quick, but most days you&#39;re speedy<br />
	Some days you use more force than is necessary.<br />
	Some days just drop in on us.<br />
	Some days are better than others.<br />
	Some days it all adds up<br />
	And what you&#39;ve got is enough.<br />
	Some days are better than others.
