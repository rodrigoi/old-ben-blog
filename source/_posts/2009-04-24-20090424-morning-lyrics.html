<blockquote>
	Take my love, take my land<br />
	Take me where I cannot stand<br />
	I don&#39;t care, I&#39;m still free<br />
	You can&#39;t take the sky from me<br />
	Take me out to the black<br />
	Tell them I ain&#39;t comin&#39; back<br />
	Burn the land and boil the sea<br />
	You can&#39;t take the sky from me<br />
	There&#39;s no place I can be<br />
	Since I found Serenity<br />
	But you can&#39;t take the sky from me...
