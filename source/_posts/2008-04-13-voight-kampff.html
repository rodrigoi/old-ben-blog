I have a simple question for you. Reaction time is an important factor, so please pay attention.
</p>
<p>
You&rsquo;re in a desert walking along in the sand when all of the sudden you look down, and you see a tortoise, crawling toward you. You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back. The tortoise lays on its back, it&#39;s belly baking in the hot sun, beating it&#39;s legs trying to turn itself over, but it can&rsquo;t, not without your help. <strong>But you&rsquo;re not helping. Why is that?</strong>
