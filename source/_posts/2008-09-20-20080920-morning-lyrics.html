<blockquote>
	There is no pain, you are receding<br />
	A distant ship&rsquo;s smoke on the horizon<br />
	You are only coming through in waves<br />
	Your lips move but I can&rsquo;t hear what you&rsquo;re sayin&rsquo;<br />
	<br />
	When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse<br />
	Out of the corner of my eye<br />
	I turned to look, but it was gone<br />
	I cannot put my finger on it now<br />
	The child is grown, the dream is gone<br />
	<br />
	I have become comfortably numb
</blockquote>
