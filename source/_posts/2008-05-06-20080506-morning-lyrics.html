<em>We could have been God&#39;s dream<br />
We could have lived the LIFE!<br />
Could have done great thing</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
Man, it would have been so nice<br />
It could have been me<br />
Could have been you<br />
We could have done anything we wanted to do<br />
And I don&#39;t know how it happened<br />
But we got it all wrong<br />
The bad don&#39;t mean anything<br />
And the good don&#39;t last too long.</em>
