I don&rsquo;t know why, but lately I find myself wondering more and more about a particular event. Maybe it&rsquo;s October; a month filled with both happy and sad memories. Or maybe it&rsquo;s because I only have a few things left to undo on my life, before really starting over.

<p>
Anyway, I just keep going back to that moment, which was kind of a breakthrough... you might say. Soon I will know why&hellip;
</p>
<p>
This is why I have a blog. Some thoughts are just too long for a twitt.

I&rsquo;d better go back to my code and my coffee&hellip;
