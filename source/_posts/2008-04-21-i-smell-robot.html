Howard: <em>Sheldon, if you were a robot, and I knew and you didn&#39;t, would you want me to tell you?</em><br />
Sheldon: <em>That depends. When I learn that I&#39;m a robot, will I be able to handle it?</em><br />
Howard: <em>Maybe, although the history of science fiction is not on your side.</em><br />
Sheldon: <em>Uh, let me ask you this: when I learn that I&#39;m a robot, will I be bound by Asimov&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">Three Laws of Robotics</a>?</em><br />
Rajesh: <em>You might be bound by them right now.</em><br />
Howard: <em>That&#39;s true, have you ever harmed a human being, or through inaction, allowed a human being to come to harm?</em><br />
Sheldon: <em>Of course not.</em><br />
Rajesh: <em>Have you ever harmed yourself or let yourself to be harmed except in cases where a human being would&#39;ve been endangered?</em><br />
Sheldon: <em>Well, no.</em><br />
Howard: <em>I smell robot.</em><br />
...<br />
Leonard: <em>Hey, what&#39;s going on?</em><br />
Sheldon: <em>Internet it&#39;s been down for half and hour.</em><br />
Rajesh: <em>Also, Sheldon may be a robot...</em>
