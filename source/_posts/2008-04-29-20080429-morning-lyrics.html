<p>
<em>Take these shoes<br />
Click clacking down some dead end street<br />
Take these shoes<br />
And make them fit<br />
Take this shirt<br />
Polyester white trash made in nowhere<br />
Take this shirt<br />
And make it clean, clean<br />
Take this soul<br />
Stranded in some skin and bones<br />
Take this soul<br />
And make it sing&nbsp;</em>
