<p>
<em>Whatever happens I&#39;ll leave it all to chance<br />
Another heartache another failed romance<br />
On and on<br />
Does anybody know what we are living for<br />
I guess I&#39;m learning<br />
I must be warmer now<br />
I&#39;ll soon be turning round the corner now<br />
Outside the dawn is breaking<br />
But inside in the dark I&#39;m aching to be free</em>
