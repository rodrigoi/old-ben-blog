<blockquote>
	And oh, when I&#39;m old and wise<br />
	Bitter words mean little to me<br />
	Autumn winds will blow right through me<br />
	And someday in the mist of time<br />
	When they asked me if I knew you<br />
	I&#39;d smile and say you were a friend of mine<br />
	And the sadness would be lifted from my eyes<br />
	Oh, when I&#39;m old and wise
</blockquote>
