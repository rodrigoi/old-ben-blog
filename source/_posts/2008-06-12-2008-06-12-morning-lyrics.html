<em>I&#39;m one card short of a full deck<br />
I&#39;m not quite the shilling<br />
One wave short of a shipwreck<br />
I&#39;m not my usual top billing<br />
I&#39;m coming down with a fever<br />
I&#39;m really out to sea<br />
This kettle is boiling over<br />
I think I&#39;m a banana tree<br />
Oh dear!<br />
<br />
I&#39;m going slightly mad<br />
I&#39;m going slightly mad<br />
It finally happened - happened<br />
It finally happened - uh huh<br />
It finally happened - I&#39;m slightly mad<br />
Oh dear!</em>&nbsp;
