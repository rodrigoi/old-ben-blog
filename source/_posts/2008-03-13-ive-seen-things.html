Blade Runner... this movie is my favorite movie ever. I love it even more than Star Wars. The only origami figure I ever made was the unicorn, and it is the only one I will never make again. Blade Runner is the perfect science fiction movie, but it&#39;s also a great love movie. And this, is the greatest love scene ever.

This is a video of my own making, taken directly from the Final Cut Collectors Edition.&nbsp;

<br />
I&#39;ve seen things you people wouldn&#39;t believe.<br />
Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.<br />
I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate.<br />
All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.<br />
Time to die.<br />
