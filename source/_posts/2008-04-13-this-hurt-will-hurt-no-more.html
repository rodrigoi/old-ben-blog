In a little while<br />
Surely you&#39;ll be mine<br />
In a little while... I&rsquo;ll be there<br />
In a little while<br />
This hurt will hurt no more<br />
I&#39;ll be home, love<br />
<br />
When the night takes a deep breath<br />
And the daylight has no air<br />
If I crawl, if I come crawling home<br />
Will you be there?<br />
<br />
In a little while<br />
I won&#39;t be blown by every breeze<br />
Friday night running to Sunday on my knees<br />
That girl, that girl she&rsquo;s mine<br />
Well I&rsquo;ve known her since,<br />
Since she was<br />
<br />
A little girl with Spanish eyes<br />
When I saw her first in a pram they pushed her by<br />
Oh my, my how you&#39;ve grown<br />
Well it&#39;s been, it&rsquo;s been... a little while<br />
<br />
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh<br />
<br />
Slow down my beating heart<br />
A man dreams one day to fly<br />
A man takes a rocket ship into the skies<br />
He lives on a star that&rsquo;s dying in the night<br />
And follows in the trail, the scatter of light<br />
Turn it on, turn it on, you turn me on<br />
<br />
Slow down my beating heart<br />
Slowly, slowly love<br />
Slow down my beating heart<br />
Slowly, slowly love<br />
Slow down my beating heart<br />
Slowly, slowly love
