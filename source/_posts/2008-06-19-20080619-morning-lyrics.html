<p>
<em>I want to trip inside your head<br />
Spend the day there&hellip;<br />
To hear the things you haven&rsquo;t said<br />
And see what you might see<br />
<br />
I want to hear you when you call<br />
Do you feel anything at all?<br />
I want to see your thoughts take shape<br />
And walk right out</em> 
</p>
