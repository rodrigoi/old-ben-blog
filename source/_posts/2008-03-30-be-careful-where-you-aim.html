<em>I don&#39;t know you <br />
And you don&#39;t know the half of it <br />
I had a starring role <br />
I was the bad guy who walked out <br />
They said be careful where you aim <br />
&#39;cause where you aim you just might hit <br />
You can hold onto something so tight <br />
You&#39;ve already lost it </em>
