<em>So, I will head out alone, hope for the best<br />
And we hang our heads down<br />
As we skip the goodbyes<br />
And you can tell the world what you want them to hear<br />
I&#39;ve got nothing left to lose, my dear<br />
So, I&#39;m up for the little white lies<br />
But you and I know the reason why<br />
I&#39;m gone, and you&#39;re still there<br />
I&#39;m gone, and you&#39;re still there<br />
I&#39;m gone, and you&#39;re still there</em>
