<blockquote>
	In the year of &#39;39 came a ship in from the blue<br />
	The Volunteers came home that day<br />
	And they bring good news of a world so newly born<br />
	Though their hearts so heavily weigh<br />
	For the earth is old and grey, little darlin&#39; we&#39;ll away<br />
	But my love this cannot be<br />
	For so many years have gone though I&#39;m older but a year<br />
	Your mother&#39;s eyes from your eyes cry to me.
