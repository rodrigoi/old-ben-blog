<blockquote>
	Some days are slippy, other days are sloppy;<br />
	Some days you can&#39;t stand the sight of a puppy.<br />
	Your skin is white, but you think you&#39;re a brother.<br />
	Some days are better than others.<br />
	Some days you wake up with her complaining.<br />
	Some sunny days you wish it was raining.<br />
	Some days are sulky, some days have a grin;<br />
	And some days have bouncers and won&#39;t let you in.<br />
	Some days you hear a voice<br />
	Taking you to another place.<br />
	Some days are better than others. 
</blockquote>
