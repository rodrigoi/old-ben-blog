<em>Sometimes I get to feelin&#39;<br />
I was back in the old days - long ago<br />
When we were kids when we were young<br />
Thing seemed so perfect - you know<br />
The days were endless we were crazy we were young<br />
The sun was always shinin&#39; - we just lived for fun<br />
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don&#39;t know<br />
The rest of my life&#39;s been just a show<br />
<br />
Those were the days of our lives<br />
The bad things in life were so few<br />
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true<br />
When I look and I find I still love you</em>
