<p>
&quot;Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend,&quot; I shrieked, upstarting &mdash;<br />
&quot;Get thee back into the tempest and the Night&#39;s Plutonian shore!<br />
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br />
Leave my loneliness unbroken!&mdash; quit the bust above my door!<br />
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!&quot;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quoth the Raven, &quot;Nevermore.&quot;
</p>
