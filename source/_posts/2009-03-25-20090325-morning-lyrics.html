<blockquote>
	Thought I fell in love the other day    <br />
	With an old friend of mine     <br />
	I was running kisses     <br />
	Down every inch of her spine     <br />
	    <br />
	We had the roof down     <br />
	The sun came shining in     <br />
	The black fact is     <br />
	That I was thinking of you 
</blockquote>
