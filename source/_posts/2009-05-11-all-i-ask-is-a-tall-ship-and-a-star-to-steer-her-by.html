<blockquote>
	I must go down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,<br />
	And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by;<br />
	And the wheel&rsquo;s kick and the wind&rsquo;s song and the white sail&rsquo;s shaking,<br />
	And a grey mist on the sea&rsquo;s face and a grey dawn breaking.<br />
	<br />
	I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide<br />
	Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied;<br />
	And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying,<br />
	And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying.<br />
	<br />
	I must go down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,<br />
	To the gull&rsquo;s way and the whale&rsquo;s way where the wind&rsquo;s like a whetted knife;<br />
	And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover,<br />
	And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick&rsquo;s over.
