A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)#.22Chicken.22_roles">chicken</a> and a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(development)#.22Pig.22_roles">pig</a> are walking down the road. The chicken says to the pig, &quot;Do you want to open a restaurant with me?&quot; The pig considers the question and replies, &quot;Yes, I&#39;d like that. What do you want to call the restaurant?&quot; The chicken replies, &quot;Ham and Eggs!&quot; The pig stops, pauses and replies, &quot;On a seccond thought, I don&#39;t think I want to open a restaurant with you. I&#39;d be commited, but you&#39;d only be involved&quot;.
