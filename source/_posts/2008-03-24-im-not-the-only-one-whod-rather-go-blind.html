Summer stretching on the grass<br />
Summer dresses pass<br />
In the shade of a willow tree<br />
Creeps a crawling over me<br />
Over me and over you<br />
Stuck together with God&#39;s glue<br />
It&#39;s going to get stickier too<br />
<br />
It&#39;s been a long hot summer<br />
Let&#39;s get under cover<br />
Don&#39;t try too hard to think<br />
Don&#39;t think at all<br />
<br />
I&#39;m not the only one<br />
Staring at the sun<br />
Afraid of what you&#39;ll find<br />
If you took a look inside<br />
I&#39;m not just deaf and dumb<br />
Staring at the sun<br />
Not the only one<br />
Who&#39;s happy to go blind<br />
<br />
There&#39;s an insect in your ear<br />
If you scratch it won&#39;t disappear<br />
It&#39;s gonna itch and burn and sting<br />
You want to see what the scratching brings<br />
Waves that leave me out of reach<br />
Breaking on your back like a beach<br />
Will we ever live in peace?<br />
<br />
&#39;Cause those that can&#39;t do<br />
Often have to<br />
And those that can&#39;t do<br />
Often have to preach<br />
<br />
To the ones<br />
Staring at the sun<br />
Afraid of what you&#39;d find<br />
If you took a look inside<br />
Not just deaf and dumb<br />
I&#39;m staring at the sun<br />
I&#39;m not the only one<br />
Who&#39;d rather go blind<br />
<br />
Intransigence is all around<br />
Military still in town<br />
Armour plated suits and ties<br />
Daddy just won&#39;t say goodbye<br />
Referee won&#39;t blow the whistle<br />
God is good but will He listen<br />
I&#39;m nearly great<br />
But there&#39;s something missing<br />
<br />
I left it in the duty free area<br />
But you never really belonged to me<br />
<br />
You&#39;re not the only one<br />
Staring at the sun<br />
Afraid of what you&#39;d find<br />
You step back inside<br />
Not sucking on my thumb<br />
I&#39;m staring at the sun<br />
I&#39;m not the only one<br />
Who&#39;s happy to go blind
