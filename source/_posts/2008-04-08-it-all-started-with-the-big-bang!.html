Our whole universe was in a hot dense state,<br />
Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started. Wait...<br />
The Earth began to cool,<br />
The autotrophs began to drool,<br />
Neanderthals developed tools,<br />
We built a wall (we built the pyramids),<br />
Math, science, history, unravelling the mysteries,<br />
That all started with the big bang!<br />
<br />
&quot;Since the dawn of man&quot; is really not that long,<br />
As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song.<br />
A fraction of a second and the elements were made.<br />
The bipeds stood up straight,<br />
The dinosaurs all met their fate,<br />
They tried to leap but they were late<br />
And they all died (they froze their asses off)<br />
The oceans and pangea<br />
See ya, wouldn&#39;t wanna be ya<br />
Set in motion by the same big bang!<br />
<br />
It all started with the big BANG!<br />
<br />
It&#39;s expanding ever outward but one day<br />
It will cause the stars to go the other way,<br />
Collapsing ever inward, we won&#39;t be here, it wont be heard<br />
Our best and brightest figure that it&#39;ll make an even bigger bang!<br />
<br />
Australopithecus would really have been sick of us<br />
Debating out while here they&#39;re catching deer (we&#39;re catching viruses)<br />
Religion or astronomy, Encarta, Deuteronomy<br />
It all started with the big bang!<br />
<br />
Music and mythology, Einstein and astrology<br />
It all started with the big bang!<br />
It all started with the big BANG!
